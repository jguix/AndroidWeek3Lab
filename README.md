## Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1.
### Week 3 Lab - Intents, Permissions and Fragments

This is week 3 Lab from Coursera course "Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1" for Android Studio.

The course has a week assignment consistent of one or several Eclipse projects with instructions.

I have imported the Eclipse projects in Android Studio so that students using this IDE can complete the assignments.
